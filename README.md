Things to think about !!!! 

- Draw a clear roadmap of the platform's Staking capability

- Burning capability ( What Media means by saying burning capability, It needs to be cleared that if they burn they their NFTs where the money should come from to reward them )

- Do we certainly need Dedicated gateways ( Pinata ) for faster data fetching? Or is it unnecessary?

- NFT.Storage: ( https://nft.storage/docs/how-to/mint-erc-1155/ ) ( Decide between infura, alchemy, nft.storage, Pinata, ... )

- **Dynamic NFTs** Tell media about this concept on your next meeting

- **Add type check for inputs**, only integers in number related ones,

- **Put the environment vairbales in the .env file**

- **Add some feature to handle the case when the transaction is rejected or canceled or whatever! Think how you can overcome this concern**

- You have enabled experimental feature (appDir) in next.config.js. **What is this statement?** resolve it

- subphase 3 ( buying ) 6 hours March 1st + 3 hours March 2nd + 

- Put external variables (drop down values) in another file, Implement alphebatic order on drop down

- **Add wallet connect warning to _App.js** to ask users to connect wallets at the start

- You'll need this **https://headlessui.com/react/dialog**, **MaterialUI**

- **While the nft is getting minted, the position of the photo is not proper ( somewhere below the transaction state message )**

- **Decimals cannot be entered within the listing price input**
